				<h1>Your arrival at Agrabah</h1>
				<h3>Hey, little biz! Here's a pretty detailed schedule of everything that is going to happen during your very first days at INSA so that you don’t get too lost when you’ll arrive. </h3>
				
				<h4>The very moment of your arrival :</h4>
				
				<p> Well…It is not the most enjoyable part, but you will have to go through it… The first thing you have to do when you arrive, after having traveled across all of France, or maybe even across the whole world, or who knows, just the opposite sidewalk, you will have to endure the administrative chain. I know that you already have had a hard time to fill in the registration form, that you have checked at least 10 times that you did not forget anything, that you struggled to find all the required documents… (If your parents did it for you, don’t forget to thank them), but this is mandatory. Anyway, the administrative chain takes place in the Pierre de Fermat building (if you have read carefully the website, you know what I am talking about). First, it might seem impressive because there are a lot of people, but you’ll see that everyone is as lost as you are, so no need to panic! In addition, there will be a stand where your beloved CdPs (=awesome 2A students organizing your integration, i.e.: us) will answer all of your questions and will guide you throughout the next part of your day. 	
					Once done with this painful but rather quick step, you'll be able to fully enjoy your integration (basically a welcome week) that we have prepared just for you. Once your registration is done, you will be able to join your INSA family which will wait for you on the grass of our department: the FIMI, just in front of the Pierre de Fermat building. After that, loads of activities will be waiting for you during the afternoon to get to know the other bizs (=the other incoming freshmen) as well as the 2nd year students, which we call the 2A, of your family. You will be able to enjoy the integration chain in the Louis Néel building which regroups a lot of fun activities (maze, escape game, blind test, and many more) taking place during the first two days of your arrival at INSA! You can redo the chain as much as you want, and make sure you spend time with your new family. It's a great occasion to get to know the 2A of your family and the new bizs who will live this year beside you and most likely become some of your closest friends. Of course, the very 2 first evenings, when all the bizuths are supposed to arrive, your family will have prepared amazing parties, helping you to get to know everyone while having the time of your life! Don’t worry, your big brother/sister (your mentor at INSA) will watch over you regardless of all the stupidities you might do. 
				</p>
	
				<h4>Integration outfit</h4>
				<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp	Don't be afraid of dressing up little biz! You'll see that being dressed up as everyone else in your class is one of the best part of the integration week. You will be able to recognize every other biz and it's another good way to meet them and make new friends. Keep in mind that there is no risk of being ridiculous! So we count on you for putting hard work in, we promise it's worth it. Indeed, you could possibly win the contest of the best outfit! But remember that even though you are a fan of Jasmine or Jaffar, you are an Aladdin, so remember, we want to see you dressed up like him and no one else!
				<br>
				Your outfit should be made of:
				<br>
				- A pair of white harem pants or loose pants 
				<br>
				- A purple t-shirt or for those who are very motivated, you can make a sleeveless purple jacket and wear a nude shirt under it.... or nothing if you wish!  
				<br>
				- A large red belt (you could use a scarf)
				<br>
				- A red hat 
				<br>
				We made an awesome video to help you better understand how you should look like and give you ideas on how to create your outfit so swipe up! 
				</p>


				<h4>The integration party </h4>
				<p> &nbsp &nbsp After, your arrival, your wonderful CdPs will have cooked an awesome show for you! Everything starts on Saturday evening. It is the night when you will be able to show us that you are the most beautiful Aladdin. (Be careful, you will have competition with the Astérix who did everything in their power to have the best costumes last year…). You will meet your family on the FIMI and they will guide towards the palace where all the magic will begin: This party will make you forget all the apprehension you can have and will mark the beginning of your new 
journey! You will see the CdPs act out just for you, little biz… But you will also ignite the whole gymnasium while assisting and participating to the election of Miss and Mister biz, and while trying hard to get the prize-winner of the best costume (put on your most beautiful harem pants and bring your most beautiful lamp) as well as the most unusual object (surprise us!).
				</p>

				<h4>The PLOUC</h4>
				<p> &nbsp &nbsp On Sunday, you will sing the colors of your family! It is during this activity that you and your beloved family, will have to unite and weld to overcome tests more adventurous than the Aladdin’s misadventure … Between magic carpet races, rescuing of Jasmine in distress and Genie’s enigmas, you will have to get yourself heard and seen on the whole campus! To do so, do not forget one (or several) ENORMOUS signs, a battle scream AND of course, your wonderful harem pants to lead your family to triumph… 
				</p>
				<img class="image2" src = "../../images/arriv_agrabah/gardes.jpg">
				<h4>The big brother/big sister night</h4>
				<p> &nbsp &nbsp After the exciting but tiring first days of class, you will probably need comfort (and love?) that your big brother/sister (who already loves you) can give you! But tonight, it is time to show that you are the best biz ever! To do so, you will meet at the K-Fêt (exceptionally you won’t need to wear your harem pants…). You will confront him/her in challenges and fun little games. To show that your big brother/sister is the best, you will have the same distinctive sign, be original! You will also be able to immortalize this generational link with the photo stand specially created for this occasion. This party is all yours and it is a great occasion to get to know each other while having fun!  
				</p>
				
				<h4>The Rally</h4>
				<p> &nbsp &nbsp During the Rally, you will need to get out of Agrabah and confront the unknown… You will be wearing your best Aladdin costume as it is time to show to all of Lyon that our students are the best! And yes, we don’t have class on Thursday afternoon so it is time to visit your new town! With your family, you will scavenge Lyon and achieve challenges that the CdPs organized with care! The goal is to have fun and set the mood on every square in Lyon! Believe us, you will never experience a better metro trip than those during the Rally (#Paquito…). At the end of the day, it is time to get to one of the last days of your integration. It will take place in Villeurbanne Chief’s house: “the town hall”.  The mayor will welcome you with all of his joyfulness and will give his famous welcome speech, don’t worry, it'll be pretty concise, he talks pretty well… Everything will end with a big buffet offered by the town hall!
				</p>
				
				<h4>The WEI </h4>
				<p> &nbsp &nbsp This is the final step of the integration and it is SOOO LIT! Our precious and beloved CoWEI will introduce you this event that is absolutely AWESOME. All we can say is that you cannot miss it! We assure you, my dear Aladdin, you are not ready for what you will live (you’ll see, after this weekend, you’ll love them at least as much as Aladdin loves Jasmine). I invite you to look at the aftermovies of the previous years to get a sneak peek of what’s coming (here's the link to last year's: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgmukGFL0DU), you will immediately understand 
that it is an event that you cannot miss it under any circumstances! However, hurry, spots are limited!
