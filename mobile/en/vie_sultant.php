				<h2>SCHOOL</h2>
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp But, my dear Aladdin, INSA is not only a great integration that your lovely CDPs (with a huge                  “boulard”) have prepared, where you meet your best friend Abu and hook up with Jasmine or Aladdin. It is also different kinds of courses: </p>
				<br><br>
				<h2 class = "title2">Amphi</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp Those are the courses where you will learn all the theoretical stuff. This is also where language your teacher is speaking. Here's some advice: Sit in the front row if you care about your future because in the back it is practically impossible to follow the course and the teacher really doesn’t care! Take some notes or do some review sheets because the “poly” (the booklet containing your courses) is way too long to learn! Finally, it is PRIMORDIAL to go to all amphis as teachers immediately notice your absence due to the fact that there is just the right amount                 of seats for everyone (100). Moreover, if you start skipping classes it quickly becomes a vicious                cycle and once you’ve tasted sleeping one more hour it is really hard not to do it again, especially on Friday mornings. (#EclatéAuSolEnAmphi).  
				</section>
				<br><br>
				
				<h2 class = "title2">TD’s</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp  With 24 other Aladdin by your side, you will do the application part of the courses by                  working on some exercises (if you’re lucky the teacher will recall the important stuff at the                beginning of the course #FloreTheBest). Those usually last 2 hours but it is really important                to do the exercises at home before hand and to know your lesson, otherwise it will just be boring                   and you will be losing some precious time because you won’t understand much of what will be                 going on. But the TD’s are also where you will have some great times and meet new friends                  #ClassRaclette! 
				</section>
				<br><br>
							
				<h2 class = "title2">TP’s (labs)</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp You'll probably have some hard times during these 3 hour labs as most of them are                  pretty difficult. Like in TD, you must read the lab beforehand. You will discover the struggles of                 working with an oscilloscope when nothing appears to be working out even though the solution               seems to be really simple. Take some notes during each lab because at the end of the                 semester there will be an evaluated lab exam (like you may have had for the graduation).                During the first semester, you will only have 3 hours of physics labs a week, but in the second                   semester, you will have 3 hours chemistry labs as well. A little piece of advice: Try to get a lab                    book from a second-year student with the correction of the labs so that you won’t waste time                 staying stuck on the same thing for an hour. 
				</section>
				<br><br>
							
				<h2 class = "title2">IEs (weekly exams)</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp You see them coming, they scare you, you think that there is no way                  you will survive them, that you are not ready... then the day arrives and you need to muster the                   courage to succeed, or not…You will certainly be disappointed once in a while, but eventually,               you'll get used to them and since you got into INSA, you definitely have the potential to progress                  (by working) and to succeed! So never lose faith, and tell yourself that the next exam will make                  up for the previous one. Sometimes it is just the teacher who decided to write a very difficult                  exam so that you won’t become too confident. (#Physics3rdIE, #TotalAverage8).
				</section>
				<br><br>
				
				<h2 class = "title2">Finals</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp Here, we call them "partiels". It is like an end of High School exam at the end of every                    semester but a little bit trickier (I know that High School was way too easy for you anyways).                  Those finals are gonna be more complicated! But don't worry, after a week of suffering, you will                 discover the post-finals party, aka the "post-partiels", that will remind you of the integration              parties… Those will comfort you so don’t plan on going to bed early that night! Only The                 SCANs, lucky ones, don’t have many finals first semester! 
				</section>		
				<br><br><br><br>
				
				<h2>CLASSES</h2>
				<br>
				<h2 class = "title2">Math</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp You probably think it’s gonna be easy because you spent high school teaching everything to everyone, maybe even to your teacher… Well at INSA, even if you’re a beast (and I'm not talking about you in bed), you’re probably gonna be the one needing help (except, if you come from Morocco, in this case, you’ll never be as proud of your country as now that it will allow you to take the greatest naps ever while doing awesome at your exams). For the other ones, the program involves studying functions, (definitions, derivatives, integrals, polynomials, so on and so on) as you probably did in high school, but much going much deeper into the subject with more complex exercises. Then, during the second semester, just when you’re starting to feel more confident after a well-deserved success, you’ll understand the meaning of the word “abstract” through vector spaces and linear maps! Don’t worry though, nothing is impossible if you study (hope you’ll all pass). Shout out to the “lanière test”, that spent the whole year doing geometry while we were struggling with Taylor expansions…
				</section>
				<div class = "image1"><img src = "../../images/vie_sultan/math.png"></div>
				<br><br>
							
				<h2 class = "title2">Chemistry</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp At INSA this subject is separated from physics. Honestly, it’s quite different from high school and it can seem a little bit complicated and mysterious at first sight but it’s completely doable, and many things can help you visualize the atoms. You’ll also learn (or re-learn) everything about spatial geometry. You’ll, for example, see that a cuboid is actually an orthorhombic structure #Crystallography. On top of that, you’ll have to learn to count again and even review your alphabetical order (#1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10??). Don’t worry though, there are plenty of nice things such as finally understanding that famous periodic table! During the second 
semester, you’ll say goodbye to this subject (without any regret) except for a few labs that will keep bothering you.
				</section>
				<div class="image1"><img src = "../../images/vie_sultan/chimie.png"></div>
				<br><br>
							
				<h2 class = "title2">Thermodynamics</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp New subject! It’s replacing chemistry for semester 2. You’ll have the pleasure to study energy exchanges of many systems of your daily life, such as your fridge, based on the model of ideal gases. You’ll also learn formulas to calculate the exchanges of heat between you and your girlfriend when it’s getting hot… Anyway, be prepared for a scientific vocabulary that's so specific, it probably doesn’t even appear in the dictionary #adiabatic #enthalpy #entropy.
				</section>
				<div class="image1"><img src = "../../images/vie_sultan/thermo.png"></div>
				<br><br>
							
				<h2 class = "title2">Physics</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp Last important subject (don’t neglect the other ones though). This year, you’ll discover the biggest debate on earth (after Brice vs the Incredibles) between mathematicians’ rigor and physicians’ approximations! You’ll see, it’s quite funny to be able to neglect a bunch of things without even understanding why! More seriously, in semester 1 you’ll be studying electrodynamics and geometric optics which are quite hard but very interesting. Then you’ll learn about mechanics, you saw the basics in high school but it’s gonna be wayyyy more advanced. Finally, the last month is dedicated to electromagnetism.
				</section>
				<br><br>
				
				<h2 class = "title2">MTES</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp Mathematical Tools for Engineering Sciences. The name of the class says it all: you’ll learn some math tools in an incomprehensible booklet that will eventually be useful for physics, so you’d better put some effort into it as it’ll be quickly considered as mastered #SphericalCoordinates even if you're still lost. However, if you’re part of an international section (except for scangang), you won’t get that chance, you’ll see everything directly in physics, no unnecessary foreplay! 
				</section>
				<div class="image1"><img src = "../../images/vie_sultan/physique.png"></div>
				<br><br>						

				<h2 class = "title2">Info</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp During your first year, you’ll learn to code in JAVA! We’re quite lucky because it’s not the hardest language to code and you can do lots of things with it! Even if that seems to be Chinese for some people, it might be the only scientific class where you just need to stay a bit focused in TD to succeed in IE (written exams). You will even have a lecture at the beginning of the year on how a computer works and about softwares you thought you already mastered like Excel or Word that have incredible functions.
				</section>
				<div class="image1"><img src = "../../images/vie_sultan/info.png"></div>
				<br><br>
				
				<h2 class = "title2">Mechanical Design</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp So, there are three different types of people at INSA. The ones who did Engineering Sciences in High School and who will succeed in everything because they know everything, the ones who did Engineering Sciences but were in a shitty High School and only did half of the program. And the ones who studied Biology (#speSVT for the most daring) who will be completely lost at the beginning and will need to catch up! You will discover Mechanical Design and 3D modeling that will allow you to understand everything about mechanisms and their compounds. Don’t worry, you will catch up quickly and even with 2/20, you can still pass at the end of the semester thanks to the famous “harmonization” of our grades. 
				</section>
				<br><br>
							
				<h2 class = "title2">Language Classes</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp This subject varies a lot depending on the sections. In the classical section, you’ll take your first TOEFL test in order to know which English group you'll be placed in for the year. But if you’re pretty good, you can even stop to study English and study another language. If you're in an international section, you will keep practicing and learning English, but you will have the opportunity to continue (or even start) another language depending on the area of the world affiliated to your section. For the SCANs, all of your subjects will be taught in English (except Physical Education). Apparently, it’s not harder but I personally already don’t understand much in French either soooo… Basically, if you are in SCAN you’re pretty smart, more or less good looking and fluent in English compared to people that keep struggling in groups 5 and 6. You understood it, young bizuth that belongs to the mortal side, make yourself a friend in SCAN (quite hard #SCANsect)  and your English homework will no longer be an issue for you! 
					</section>
				<br><br>
							
				<h2 class = "title2">Knowledge of a Company</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp It’s not the hardest subject. Basically, you will be taught various things about life in a company and how it works. You’ll just have a project and a study of a case to do and it will be done. Try to follow in class and you will pass the year! PS: this subject is dedicated to the Classical section only.
				</section>
				<br><br>

				<h2 class = "title2">Culture Sciences and Society</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp You will quickly start to call it CSS as it is as boring as its name is long. But this is mandatory, and it is one of the subjects of “the Humanities” revendicated by INSA. They will be the unique non-scientific subjects that you will study in TD (work in class and in groups of 25). It still provides a pretty appreciable break and if you like oral expression and debates, you’re gonna love it! For the international sections, you will get the chance to study the different aspects of the culture linked to the geographical zones corresponding to your section. 
				</section>
				<br><br>
				<h2>The sections</h2>
				<br>
				<h2 class = "title2">"Classique"</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp Most people belong to this section, the real hardcore of the school. You will be divided into 5 "lanières" of a 100 students each, that you'll learn to love with all your heart as lectures and tutorials go by. If at first sight, you'll think this section looks like nothing special, you will be 
surprised! The "Classiques" are kind of a beacon for the entire school year when it comes down to studying really hard during some periods. In a word, a true section in its own! 
				</section>
				<br><br>
				<h2 class = "title2">SCAN</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp And, saving the best till last, the SCAN section, where every lesson is given in English. In theory, it's a section where half the people are foreigners -the other half being French-, in practice, there are way more French people, and the English of some teachers is... let's say doubtful. But don't worry, if you are in SCAN, you'll discover the joys of being in a section with a 
lot of life and cohesion, where most students speak good English. Even if others love to say so, we're not a sect (okay, maybe just a little...), but rather a big family, in addition to your integration family. All in all, being in SCAN is a state of mind, a lot of events over the year (Barbecues, Pi-Day, SCAN trips...) and some beautiful encounters. If you're not in SCAN, yes you'll hear us talk in English a little too loud in the hallways, but please don't hate us for it, wherever you'll end up we'll love you young biz!
				</section>
				<br><br>
				<h2 class = "title2">EURINSA</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp Here, it is double or nothing! Quite often on Thursday nights, while every other section will be studying for their Friday test, you won't, since you don't have exams each week. But sometimes, you'll have 3 or 4 tricky exams in a single week, so you'll have to hold on. By definition, you are THE European citizen, and you will hear many different languages in your class. So don't worry if, at the beginning of the year, you sometimes mistake Romanian for Bulgarian or Greek, this kind of thing happens. It is certainly the section with the widest cultural and linguistic diversity. Whether you're French or a foreigner, you'll meet people of all backgrounds, and that's a great richness! 
				</section>
				<br><br>
				<h2 class = "title2">AMERINSA</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp ¿♫ Queremos saber si estas en Amerinsa ♫!? If it is the case, it won't be long before you sing this song too, along with the 2nd year students. In Amerinsa, you will discover the "Ameros" (French play on words between "Amer" and "Apéro"). You'll maybe start dancing the tango, bachata, salsa... it's up to you! Even if you're not in Amerinsa, you'll quickly meet these Hispanic students, always talking out loud in your dorms' corridors. No hard feelings, it's the sun of Latin America flowing through their veins, and they bring a good mood with them everywhere on campus! 
				</section>
				<br><br>
				<h2 class = "title2">ASINSA</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp If you are in Asinsa, you'll very likely be with foreigners from Vietnam or China all the time. So please, don't tell your roommate that "being a Chinese or a Vietnamese person is one and the same thing". It is as dangerous as asking my Moroccan friend Soukaïna if she is Algerian, very sensitive subject. But don't worry, it won't be war in your class! On the contrary, you will be able to enrich one another with your own cultures. Of course, you'll have to get used to the smell of their food, but as far as taste is concerned, you'll see it's delicious! My roommate was Vietnamese, and I learned many things living with him, I hope it will be the same for you!

				<h2>ACTIVITIES</h2>
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp Heyyyy little biz, how was this integration? Even if we’re not there yet, a fortune teller of mine saw in his crystal ball that you really were incredible bizs, that both the CdPs and the 2As were amazed by all of you! Anyways, it’s only the beginning and I’m sure you’ll find cool friends to go with you to the BU, the K-Fêt and all the different events that take place every year at INSA. Indeed little biz, life at INSA is not only about your integration and you will have tons of opportunities to discover it through the associations, the K-Fêt, and countless parties! Here’s a summary of the main events you can take part in throughout the year: </p>
				<br><br>
				<h2 class = "title2">Prom</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp Don't think about it for too long: for prom, dress up with your best suits or your sparkliest dress and come fire up the dance floor all night long! Who knows, maybe you'll wake up in the arms of the Aladdin/Jasmine of your wildest dreams... usually to end up spending a pretty resting Saturday in bed to compensate for the agitated night you just had.

				<br><br><br>
				
				<h2 class = "title2">Humanitarian Karnaval</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp The Karna is like if the whole Agrabah Souk was coming on campus for a whole week to bring concerts, workshops, and conferences right to you. Believe me, it’s a good way to take your mind off your textbooks. Tents, stages, these people know how to stand out and it will be great entertainment with the good weather coming back (that you will be waiting for resolutely). Moreover, the benefits of the events will be used to pay for projects or support aid organizations.

				<br><br><br>
						
				<h2 class = "title2">High Five</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp The High Five will be THE event where the 6 INSAs of France will fight (ok we’re not that good in maths...) i.e. the INSA of Strasbourg, Toulouse, Rennes, Rouen, Centre Val de Loire and of course Lyon. But how do they fight exactly? Through a lot of sports competitions, music concerts, cultural and science contests. These competitions are accessible for everyone, provided you’re all set for it and ready to fit the mood! It’s an incredible opportunity for you to represent Agrabah in front of the world and to prove that even if we’re big-headed, we can count up to 5!

				<h2 class = "title2">The 24H of INSA</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp In one sentence: the biggest French festival organized by students, where thousands of people meet on our campus (and usually some cool artists!) for three crazy days of concerts, recreational activities, and races. Here's a little tip though: make sure get your tickets ASAP as they will disappear faster than a puddle in the middle of the desert.

				<br><br><br>
						
				<h2 class = "title2">The Raid</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp Spartans, what is your prof... ok it might be a bit too much. Even though you would definitely need the training of a spartan to hold up during the raid. If you volunteer, you and your 3 sporty fellows will live an intense sports experience in some place that is not known yet, but awesome for sure. Believe me, the organization staff knows their job. For 3 days, activities like running, cross cycling, kayaking, climbing or orienteering will come one after another... at a sustained pace. A piece of advice: if you are interested in participating, make sure you don't take too long to get back to training after your integration, or it'll be tough!

				<br><br><br>
						
				<h2 class = "title2">The Gala</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp Living the Gala is somehow a bit like attending the Cendrillon ball, excepted that you don’t have any dough, no fame and that you’re clearly not interested in glass shoes. But because we know that, as a good biz, you like to keep that "bon esprit" vibe, we don’t doubt any moment that you will volunteer to organize the Gala for the 5th year students that graduate this year. As a member of the organization staff, you will make your contribution to this great event and help the "old" students to enjoy their last time together. Come one, get motivated biz, it’s really an incredible experience to live. After all, it’s only a like for like system as the first year students will do it for you when it'll be your turn to graduate!

				<h2>Associations</h2>
				<br>
				<img class="image1" src="../../images/vie_sultan/va.png">
				<br>
				<h2 class = "title2">An asso?</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp The community life is one of the biggest aspect of the life at INSA. Your future school count 133 associations today !
				<br><br>
					&nbsp &nbsp For example, if your dream hobby is to create an high-tech lamp (or whatever high tech thing in fact) you may join the Club'Elek or the FabLab. You can visit the "Bikers" to borrow a skate or to ask them to repair your lovely bike! 
				<br>
					You like playing an instrument? No worries, there are plenty if musical organizations! In fact you can find an association for almost everything you like to do!
				<br><br>
					&nbsp &nbsp You will discover those during the "Association Forum" at the begining of the year !
				</section>
				<br><br>
							
				<h2 class = "title2">AS (sports)</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp INSA will offer you the possibility to continue practicing your favorite sport! Being a member of a sportive association can be a great experience (for example being closer and closer of your teammates) and it will dispense you from sport classes.

				<h2>Your family</h2>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp Ah, family… If you’re the type of person who always pays their debts or if you’re simply part of the Slytherin House, I feel like you already understand the concept of a family at INSA. As the journey to the RI can be tedious, your favorite CdP consulted the best fortune tellers of Agrabah to get you the best big brother and therefore the best family according to your personality, hobbies… (for that you’ll first need to fill in our humble questionnaire). Your family will be composed of cool and nice people (1st and 2nd years) with whom you should have affinities and will share unforgettable moments during the integration week while defending the colors of your family. After all, YOU are the best and you will have to make the other bizuths understand that... but all of this in a friendly atmosphere (friendly advice, prepare some throat lozenges, it might become quite handy for you or one of your friends...).						
				</section>
				<br>
				<div class="image2"><img src="../../images/vie_sultan/famille.jpg"></div>
				<br>
				<section>
					&nbsp &nbsp But the concept of family does not stop there, it is also a landmark that will accompany you in your new life at INSA: you will quickly discover the (more or less) large family meals at the RI after a long day of class, the aperitifs and the outings, or the legendary Godfather Party (rumor has it this is a mysterious feast worthy of the greatest sultans... your 2A will tell you soon enough).
					<br><br>
					&nbsp &nbsp In short, lots of good things await you to make sure that you find the right people who match you and that will enable you to easily feel welcome at your beautiful new school. 
					<br><br>
					&nbsp &nbsp P. S.: Hey you, yes I’m talking to you, young and anxious bizuth. No matter what, don’t worry, the family system is, above all, set up to guide you and make sure that everything is going well, you will never be forced to do anything, and if you, unfortunately, find that the cactuses are greener elsewhere, nothing forbids you to get your oasis from other people/families. Anyway, give a chance to the family that has been assigned to you, we always give our best to do things right! (And be aware of the buyings on the PC when you arrive, you will have time to discover what suits you best later).
				</section>	
				<br><br>
				<h2>YOUR BIG BROTHER - BIG SISTER</h2>
				<section>
					Your big brother or big sister is the person who will be there for you as soon as you arrive at INSA, and who will accompany you through your first steps in your new life as well as throughout the whole year: moral support, advice, attentive ear or invaluable host at the end of a party, it's like your personal genie of the lamp just for you. Even if you don’t know each other yet, don’t worry, they already love you more than all the other bizuths (#HeLovesYou3000, shed a tear if you got it) and you will have the opportunity to share some quality moments with them. 
					<br><br>
					They’ll be like your little designated mentor, to encourage you when you’re down, to give you tips to study for your upcoming IE, to go out in Lyon with you or to share a meal of lineage... in short, they’ll be a hero that you can look up to, who will always there for you, no matter what.

					You know what they say, there is no smoke without fire, and no integration without us, your CdPs team (officially short for Patronage Committee, unofficially for various sketchy acronyms that you’ll soon discover). In a nutshell, it’s a group of 100 students who were elected after an intense week of campaigning in order to organize your integration, and are doing their best to 
					make it a memorable experience! A CdP is a person working super hard all throughout the integration week to entertain you, just because your pleasure is his pleasure (you will also find amazing people in your family don’t worry, being a CdP is, above all, a state of mind you see). 
					<br><br>
					They are also in charge of the website you’re browsing through right now, and the tiny colored booklets that will help you study for your IE.  
					<br><br>
					P. S.: If it turns out that you are one of their bizuths, you will share your big brother/sister with a coBizuth, for better and for worse... (but mostly for the better we promise).
