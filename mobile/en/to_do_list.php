			<h1>TO DO LIST</h1>
			<p class = "subTitle">
				&nbsp &nbsp You thought you were over with all the boring paperwork of Parcoursup or college applications, but the good news is that you are not! We don't want you to be completely lost before the beginning of the year so we came up with the To Do List of things that you need to get done before your integration. 
			</p>

			<h2>Pendant les vacances</h2>
			<section>
