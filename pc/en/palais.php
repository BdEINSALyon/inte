			<h1>Your palace</h1>
			<p class = "subTitle">
				&nbsp &nbsp Once arrived on the campus and when you are done with all the administrative part, you will finally discover your new big and beautiful palace… of 16m^2. Don’t worry, it may seems small but you will get used to it quickly. 
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<img id="al_home" src="../../images/palais/aladdin_home.jpg">
			<br><br>
			<h2>Roommate</h2>
			<section>
				&nbsp &nbsp You will share your turne (yesss now your room is called a « turne ») with another Jasmine in the A residence or another Aladdin in the B residence. You can even decide of a nice name for your turne as l’afturne, la comfyturne, la taciturne, or even claim your respective families by putting post it notes on your windows. From your windows, if you’re in the A residence, you’ll either see the pc lawn or the B residence, so in the B residence you’ll either see the A or the graveyard. 
			</section>
			<br><br>
			<section>
				&nbsp &nbsp In your turne, you might organise small parties, hang around with some friends (or your lovely Jasmine or Aladdin, but careful, the beds are smaaaall) or even work a little although the bests go to the BU (your second home). 
			</section>
			<br><br>
			<section>
				&nbsp &nbsp So now, your little palace is already filled with some stuffs : bed, desk, chair, bedside lamp, shelves, closet, a bathroom with a shower and a washbasin, and a small kitchen with an induction plate and a refrigerator. The only thing missing are the toilets, but don’t worry they’re in the corridor not far from your place. Oh and the washbasin is also used as a sink which is not the nicest thing but you’ll get used to it.
