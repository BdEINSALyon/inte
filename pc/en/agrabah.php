			<h1>AGRABAH</h1>
			<p class = "subTitle">
				&nbsp &nbsp Young Aladdin, you might be coming from very far away, chances that you’ve never been to the wonderful city of Lyon, you may have never even heard of it before… If you’re sad about leaving your hometown, the sunny and warm weather of the desert, your family or even your Jasmine (who won’t be your princess for much longer #NovemberTheorem), or if you have doubts concerning your new Agrabah, don’t worry, Lyon is a city with a compelling history and culture and it’s also quite beautiful! Even if you’ll love staying on campus and walking back and forth to the Beurk to eat dinner with your dear family, or chilling at the K-Fêt (#Traquenard), you might want to leave your palace once in a while and, just like Jasmine, go wandering in the city on your magic carpet! You’re lucky, your lovely CDPs are here to help guide you. We’ll be your personal tour guides and we’ll share our best tips with you to fully enjoy the city.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2>SPORTS</h2>
			<section>
			&nbsp &nbsp  If you’re not satisfied with the many AS (Sports Associations) that the school offers, don't worry, you will find whatever it is you’re looking for somewhere else! If you like running to clear your head after a hard day of tough classes, you can either go to the Parc de la Feyssine, run along the Rhône river, explore the famous Parc de la Tête d’Or, or, for the bravest, go to Fourvière where you’ll discover quite a view of the city as a reward. You can easily find a lot of skateparks, soccer and basketball fields in the city as well as close to the A and B buildings (your dorm). There are also skating rinks close by if you’re into ice skating. You will be able to support our local soccer teams (except if you’re from the 42, then it could be dangerous) at the Groupama stadium or basketball teams at the Astroballe. We are not forgetting you little biz from the south of France, if you’re looking for a petanque ground, there is one between the C and D buildings.

			<h2>Shopping</h2>
			<section>
			&nbsp &nbsp  If you’re not an athlete that’s fine too, you can easily find what you’re looking for in terms of shopping. The Part-Dieu shopping mall has a lot of stores, I’m sure there is at least one made for you, and it’s very easy to go there from campus. If you have a bigger budget, you should try Confluence, it's further away but it's really beautiful. But the best neighborhood to go shopping is from Bellecour to Hôtel de Ville, you can wander in the beautiful old streets of the center of the city where you'll find everything you're looking for, even thrift shops! And last but not least, you can also go to the old Lyon, it’s a very charming neighborhood, the perfect place for a nice dinner with your Jasmine.

			<h2>Food</h2>
			<br>
			<section>
			&nbsp &nbsp You're tired of eating at the RI on campus and you want to enjoy a meal you’ll remember? Lyon is the perfect place for you! Go to Collonges to eat at the famous gastronomic restaurant of Bocuse! Out of budget? That’s fine, you can still go to the institutes Bocuse at Ecully or to Bellecour! Still out of budget? Then strike for Charpennes for sushi, tacos or something at 
McDonald, or plan a quick trip to Part-Dieu mall if you’re more of a Burger King kind of guy. If you'd like, you can find a KFC at Vaux-en-Velin and Kebab restaurants that are still open at 5am ;) And of course, if you’re lazy, Uber eats is made for you! Finally, we’ll let you discover the tradition of the Flam’s with your family, we don’t want to spoil too much of it (it would be worse than spoiling Game of Thrones trust me…).

			<h2>Culture</h2>
			<br>
			<section>
			&nbsp &nbsp You are an intellectual sultan? You want to be a smartass for your beloved Jasmine and show off your knowledge for arts? Then you should go and visit the museum of fine arts at Confluence (it´s really nice and since you´re a student, theoretically it's not too expensive). There's also the Gallo-Roman Museum or the Museum of Contemporary Art at the International City. You can get lost in the old Lyon (it's always better than to get lost in vector spaces), you can go to Bellecour or Terreaux Square to take the nicest picture for Instagram, Kylie Jenner style (with fewer likes, let's be honest!). If you´re thinking of participating in the tech sections in 2nd year, you can go watch theater plays at the théâtre des Célestins or little plays in coffee-theaters of the old Lyon. If you felt sorry about the fire at Notre-Dame, you can go visit our magnificent Fourvière Basilica to cheer you up (but don't burn this one down!).

			<br><br>
			<h2>Events</h2>
			<br>
			<section>
			&nbsp &nbsp There are many, many events, you’ll be informed in due time throughout the year. Thanks to the amazing BDE (student administration) and the associations of INSA Lyon you won't be bored. Moreover, since you don’t live in an abandoned town in the middle of the desert, some of the best artists perform here, and they'll come set the mood at the Transbordeur. If you like festivals, buy your tickets for the Reperku which is super cool! (but remember, the 24h festival >>> any other festival). Finally, in Lyon we are lucky to host a well known event, the famous Lyon light festival! It really is beautiful, so if you have never seen it before, you should definitely go check it out (good luck with the metro) especially since it's free!

			<h2>Partying</h2>
			<br>
			<section>
			&nbsp &nbsp No need to be shy, we all know the reason why you chose INSA instead of a prépa! Don't worry, we're all the same, even your favorite CDPs (especially us in fact #AtTheBeginningWeWere100). So, of course, there is the magic cavern, the K-Fêt! But if you want to go out more, you can head towards Hotel de Ville for a little old fashion Barathon, you´ll discover some really nice places! Otherwise, head to the docks of the Saone with friends after the good old test of Friday afternoon (well, except if you're in Eurinsa) to chill & relax, but not to jump into the river... Now, if you love to dance, and you want to find a Jasmine or a Aladdin for the night or just have a blast with friends, take your usual harem pants off, wear your nicest outfit and give a try to Lyon's night clubs. Big shoutout to l'Ayers (except if you're 1m90 tall and you have the tendency to jump everywhere like me, the ceiling tends to be pretty low), which is located on a houseboat, and to the LOFT

			<br><br>
			<h2>Transport</h2>
			<br>
			<section>
			&nbsp &nbsp Ok, because everything I just mentioned isn't on the nearest sand dune, and some of these dunes are pretty high (you'll understand what I mean when you'll want to impress your girlfriend by climbing up to Fourvière). You won't be concerned if as a good sultan, you have a good magic carpet or if you have the powers of Jafar, but it can be useful for all the others. You live in a big city, hence your favorite sultan placed some Vélo'v and some electric scooters that are fairly accessible to anyone (but it's certainly less cool than a carpet). If you're really lazy there is public transportation. Basically, you'll take the T1 tram near the A/B buildings to go to Part-Dieu, or Charpennes to then take the metro A to go to Bellecour. Oh! I almost forgot! The royal guard knows how to blend in and knows that at INSA there are many bizs to control, so be careful!! Because as an INSA student, you know that an arithmetic sequence of about -60 euros (because you “forgot” your ticket) rapidly becomes hugely negative, and it would suck not to be able to afford pints at the K-Fêt on Thursday nights anymore!
